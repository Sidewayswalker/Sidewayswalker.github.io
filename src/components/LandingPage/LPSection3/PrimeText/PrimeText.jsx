        I had the privilege of attending Prime Digital Academy, 
        an immersive, in-person boot camp that transforms 
        passionate learners into skilled software engineers. 
        This rigorous program provided hands-on experience in 
        full stack development through a blend of technical 
        training, solo projects, group collaborations, and 
        real-world challenges, all designed to mirror the 
        professional software development lifecycle. The 
        collaborative environment fostered growth through 
        shared learning, teamwork, and diverse perspectives 
        while building functional applications and tackling 
        complex problems, equipping me with the tools, mindset, 
        and confidence to thrive in the tech industry.
